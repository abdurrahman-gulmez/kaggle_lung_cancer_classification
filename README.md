This project has been gaved me from [Codeep](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9811775/) after weekly lesson about machine learning. I have received dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com"). In this project, I tried to predict lung cancer using the columns that had relationship between lung cancer column. Also, I used some graphs to analize data and after analizing the data, I did predicton with hyperparametre optimization by using RandomizedSearchCV.
